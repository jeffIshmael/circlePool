# CirclePool

**Transform your savings group into a community bank.**

CirclePool is a decentralized rotating savings and micro-lending platform built on Hedera Hashgraph. It takes the traditional chama (rotating savings group) model and adds blockchain transparency, automated management, and sustainable wealth-building capabilities.

## What is CirclePool?

CirclePool combines the trust and familiarity of traditional rotating savings groups with blockchain technology to create transparent, automated, and sustainable community wealth-building platforms.

### The CirclePool Innovation

Unlike traditional rotating savings where 100% of funds are distributed, CirclePool introduces a **retention mechanism**:
- Each payout splits between the member and a growing Group Reserve
- The creator sets the retained percentage (typically 15-25%)
- The reserve enables micro-lending to members at group-set interest rates
- Interest earned grows the shared fund for the entire community

**Result**: Your savings circle evolves into a sustainable, self-managed community bank.

## Key Features

- **Automated Rotations**: Smart contracts manage contributions and payouts automatically
- **Micro-Lending**: Borrow from your group's growing reserve fund at transparent interest rates
- **Blockchain Transparency**: All transactions are immutable and verifiable on Hedera Hashgraph
- **Near-Zero Fees**: Transactions cost less than $0.01 on the Hedera network
- **Fast Settlement**: Complete transactions in seconds
- **Growing Reserve**: Watch your circle fund grow through retained savings and loan interest
- **Mobile-First**: Access and manage your circles from anywhere

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Blockchain**: Hedera Hashgraph
- **Deployment**: Optimized for Vercel

## How It Works

1. **Create or Join**: Start a new savings circle or join an existing one
2. **Regular Contributions**: Members contribute fixed amounts on a set schedule
3. **Rotational Payouts**: Each member receives their turn, with a portion retained in the reserve
4. **Micro-Lending**: Borrow from the growing reserve fund at group-set interest rates
5. **Sustained Growth**: The reserve continues growing through loans and retained savings
